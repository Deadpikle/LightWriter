# LightWriter

LightWriter is a basic online web application that can be used to teach very basic programming concepts, such as loops and conditionals. LightWriter was created for a computer science project at Southern Adventist University and represents the work of a single semester. Much (if not all) of the code needs refactoring, cleaning up, and other basic improvements, but the basic site is fully functional as-is. It's also kinda fun.

### Save/Load/Login

The system was created with basic saving, loading, and log-in functionality. Currently, this repo has no database connection string or sample database. Eventually, a sample MS SQL database will be supplied in this repository, and hopefully there will soon be a live version of the application running once again.
