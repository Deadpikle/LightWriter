TODO
=====
    ====Code related items====
	-Change "remove color" to "default color" in multiple places
	-Can the user change blocks during execution?
		-If not, optimize blocks by only calculating rows/cols/squares on first run ("init" step)
			-also checks for good/bad input in certain cases of blocks
		-If so, only calculate them upon selection change (since right now it is horribly
			unoptimized)
	-Fully integrate GUI.js grid with the LightGrid() class [aka combine them into the
        LightGrid class]
		-This has changed somewhat, revisit this later
	-Use loops in the default.aspx (or html templating or something) so that the aspx file is cleaner/shorter
	-Use better block inheritance in the blocks
	-Optimize blocks and clean up block code
	-Change labels in blocks upon selection change; i.e. when the user selects a plural of ticks it says "ticks"
		and when the user selects "1" for # of ticks it says "tick."
	-Refactor ajaxServicesAndDialogs.js file stuff with login session check stuff so that it is nicer
	-Fix all the stupid issues where numbers are turning into strings and vice versa in the JS which confuses the C#
	-Make all blocks use the new constructObject() syntax to initialize values
		-Actually, make them do inheritance the RIGHT WAY: 
			http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4152931/javascript-inheritance-call-super-constructor-or-use-prototype-chain
	-Remove all the "block" appended types off the block classes (redundant info)
	-set up "classes" better by using the prototype? (functionsAndClasses.js, mostly pertains to blocks)
	-Create an ErrorDictionary type for easier returns

    ====Server related items=====
    -Set up the server to use HTTPS so that password transfer is secure
    -Be unlazy and send back more nicely formatted items (aka actually get around to making
        classes for everything blah blah blah -- too time consuming at this point)

    ====Eventual nice features====
    -Convert logging in/out system to ASP.Net login control which should automatically
        manage logging in, out, and password recovery.
        -Might not be able to integrate this with other user tables if we can't get ids
        -Might be a huge pain and not worth the effort

	==== BUGS ====
	IE: no shadows on hovered buttons
